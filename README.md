## üìä Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is designed to be highly interactive and consists of several interconnected visualizations:
---
### üìà Shipping Cost Trend
- Visualization: Line Chart
- Insight: Tracks the total shipping cost over time (from 2011 to 2017), allowing for identification of trends, fluctuations, and significant changes in shipping expenses.

### üí∞ Profit Margin by Category
- Visualization: Scatter Plot
- Insight: Displays profit versus sales for various product categories (e.g., Paper Art, Storage, Machines, Bookcases, Chairs). This helps in understanding which categories are most profitable, which have high sales but low profit, and which might require strategic attention.

### üì¶ Order Priority Breakdown
- Visualization: Pie Chart
- Insight: Shows the distribution of different order priorities (Critical, High, Medium, Low) as a percentage of total orders. This can highlight operational bottlenecks or areas where order fulfillment processes might need optimization.

### üåé Sales By Region
- Visualization: Bar Chart
- Insight: Compares total sales across different regions (e.g., Central, South, East, Western Europe, Canada, etc.). This visualization helps in identifying top-performing regions and areas that may need sales initiatives.
